Each of the optimization methods listed above have found sufficient solutions that match the 
Experimental ~2:1 Cl to H+ ratio for ClC-ec1. The Scipy methods have also included reasonable boundary conditions to find such a solution. 

The custom optimization script runs a Conjugate gradient descent optimizations method that has been 
Custom coded into the program itself. 

Scipy and SpotPy sections use the pre-coded optimization methods within these python programs.
